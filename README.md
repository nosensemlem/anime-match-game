# Anime Match Game

Before I went to the NaviSoft firm for an interview, I created this quick app to practise C Sharp and WPF.  
It adheres to the Pikachu game's fundamental logic. The rules of the game are rather simple: there are 16 cells, 
8 pairs of identical photographs, two identical photographs are chosen, and those two photographs disappear.  
The object of the g is to remove every tile in the shortest amount of time possible.  
Good luck.
